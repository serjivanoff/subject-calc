Create	a	program	that	allows	users	to	enter	addition,	subtraction,	multiplication	and	division	operations.
For	example:
2+2=
4-7=
3*2=
3/4=
They should	also be	able to	type	in	the	names	of	objects:
2 dogs	+	3	dogs	=	5	dogs
3 cats+	4	dogs=7	cats	and	dogs
2 tables	+4	dogs+2	books=	8	tables,	dogs	and	books
2 tables*3	tables=6	tables
7 rabbits-3	rabbits=4	rabbits
Please	note	the	following:
1.  The	program	should	be	able	to	handle	different	spacing	for	input	(meaning	2+			3	=		should	work	just
like 2+3=)
2.  If	the	user	enters	objects	for	subtraction, make sure the	answer	does	not	become	negative.		For
example,	4-7=	is	fine,	but	4	dogs-7dogs	does	not	make sense since	the	answer	would	be	-3	dogs.
3.  Make	sure	division	can	return	decimal	values.		For	example, 7/2=	should	return	would	be	3.5	NOT	3.
4.  If	the	user	enters	objects	for	division,	make	sure	you	do	not	allow	division	on	objects	that	would	have	a
remainder.		For	example,		7/2=3.5	is	fine,	but	7	dogs/2	dogs does	not	make	sense	since	the	answer
would	be	3.5	dogs.
5.  The	only	operation that	have can different	types of objects	is	+ (addition).		For	/	(division),	*
(multiplication)	and	-	(subtraction), the	objects	MUST be	the	same. For	example,	the	user	CANNOT
enter 2 tables * 3 rabbits= 6 tables	and	rabbits.
